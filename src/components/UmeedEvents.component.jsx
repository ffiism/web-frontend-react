                Gee filled with swirling bright colours, just waiting
                for an opportunity to spill out and paint
                the world. Chitrahaar is a platform for the
                budding artists in the schools of Dhanbad to
                portray their side and compete against the
                best counterparts in the town. With every mind
                that thinks creatively and brings pen to paper,
                they show their side of magic to the world.
